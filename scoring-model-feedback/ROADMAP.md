**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

### Objectives
Create validation report showing how well the model's rankings match user expectations.

### Tasks

#### 3.1 Validation Calculation
- [ ] Calculate scores for all complete jobs using current weights
- [ ] Determine model rank for each job
- [ ] Compare model rank vs user's expected rank
- [ ] Calculate match percentage
- [ ] Categorize jobs: matched, mismatched, incomplete

#### 3.2 Report UI
- [ ] Summary cards (match %, total jobs, matched/mismatched counts)
- [ ] Mismatched jobs table with details:
  - Job title & company
  - User's expected rank
  - Model's calculated rank
  - Model score
  - Individual criterion scores
- [ ] Matched jobs list (collapsible/expandable)
- [ ] Incomplete jobs warning

#### 3.3 Interactivity
- [ ] Filter view (show all / mismatches only / matches only)
- [ ] Sort table by different columns
- [ ] Export validation report as CSV
- [ ] Link back to bulk test tab to adjust scores

#### 3.4 Weight Tuning Helper
- [ ] Show which criteria contributed most to mismatches
- [ ] Suggest weight adjustments (optional, advanced)
- [ ] Button to go back to Single Test tab to adjust weights

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Clear visual display of match percentage

- [ ] Clear localStorage with data export option
- [ ] Session naming and notes

#### 4.4 Documentation

## 📝 Notes for Captain

### Decisions Made
- **Single-page app:** Easier state management, faster than multi-page
- **Vanilla JS:** No framework overhead, lightweight, fast
- **LocalStorage:** No server needed, instant save, works offline
- **CSV format:** Universal, easy to share, familiar to users
- **Tab navigation:** Clear separation of concerns, easy to extend

### Trade-offs
- **No backend:** Can't share sessions across devices (acceptable for internal tool)
- **LocalStorage limits:** ~5MB max (sufficient for 100+ jobs)
- **No undo/redo:** Keep it simple (can always re-upload CSV)
- **Basic validation:** Focus on happy path (advanced edge cases not critical)

### When to Use This Tool
1. **Initial setup:** Configure criteria and weights
2. **Testing phase:** Upload jobs, score based on gut feeling
3. **Validation:** Compare model vs intuition
4. **Tuning:** Adjust weights, re-validate, iterate
5. **Export:** Save final config and test results
6. **Deploy:** Use tuned config in main app

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 3)
1. Implement validation calculation logic
2. Build validation report UI
3. Add export validation CSV
4. Test with full 20-job workflow

### Short-term (Phase 4)
1. Visual polish and refinements
2. Write user documentation
3. Final testing and bug fixes
4. Deploy to team for feedback

### Long-term (Post-MVP)
1. Gather user feedback
2. Prioritize feature requests
3. Consider integration with main app
4. Iterate based on real usage patterns

---

**Current Status:** Ready for Phase 3 🚀
**Next Task:** Implement validation report to show match percentage between user expectations and model rankings.
