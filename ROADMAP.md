# Development Roadmap - Job Tracking and Scoring System

**Current Status:** Infrastructure complete, ready for Phase 1 development

For detailed phase breakdowns, see [@project_documentation/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md](project_documentation/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md)

---

## üéØ Current Phase: Phase 1 - Database & API Foundation

### Next Immediate Tasks

#### 1.1 Environment Configuration ‚è≥
- [ ] Populate `backend/.dev.vars` with Supabase credentials
- [ ] Populate `frontend/.env` with API URL and Supabase keys
- [ ] Test environment variable loading in both apps

**Files Needed:**
- `backend/.dev.vars` (create from `.env.example`)
- `frontend/.env` (create from `.env.example` if it exists)

**Supabase Credentials Location:**
- Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
- Project Settings ‚Üí API (URL, anon key, service_role key)

---

#### 1.2 Database Schema Implementation üìä
- [ ] Create migration scripts for Supabase
- [ ] Implement tables:
  - `jobs` - Cached job data
  - `job_scores` - Individual scoring inputs
  - `job_rankings` - Calculated A/B/C ranks
  - `pipeline_snapshots` - Candidate pipeline data
  - `users` - Team members
  - `sync_log` - Recruiterflow sync tracking
- [ ] Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- [ ] Create seed data for testing (4 users, 10-15 sample jobs)
- [ ] Test database queries

**Reference:**
- Full schema: [@project_documentation/DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md](project_documentation/DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md#database-schema-supabase)

**Tools:**
- Supabase SQL Editor (web dashboard)
- Or migration files in `backend/migrations/` (create directory)

---

#### 1.3 Recruiterflow API Exploration üîå
- [ ] Obtain Recruiterflow API credentials
- [ ] Test key endpoints:
  - `GET /jobs` - List jobs
  - `GET /jobs/:id` - Job details
  - `GET /jobs/:id/candidates` - Pipeline data
- [ ] Document available fields and map to internal schema
- [ ] Test webhook delivery (create test endpoint)
- [ ] Verify webhook signature validation method

**Reference:**
- Integration details: [@project_documentation/DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md](project_documentation/DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md#recruiterflow-integration)

---

#### 1.4 Git Repository Initialization (Optional) üì¶
- [ ] Initialize Git (`git init`)
- [ ] Create `.gitignore` (ensure `.env`, `.dev.vars` excluded)
- [ ] Initial commit
- [ ] Create GitHub/GitLab repository
- [ ] Push to remote

**Reference:**
- Git conventions: [@project_documentation/GIT_WORKFLOW.md](project_documentation/GIT_WORKFLOW.md)

---

### Phase 1 Completion Criteria ‚úÖ
- Database schema deployed to Supabase
- Sample data seeded for testing
- Recruiterflow API access confirmed
- Environment variables configured
- (Optional) Git repository initialized

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 weeks

---

## üìÖ Upcoming Phases (Summary)

### Phase 2: Backend API Development (Week 3-4)
**Focus:** Core API structure, authentication, job data endpoints, Recruiterflow integration

**Key Deliverables:**
- Working API with authentication
- Job data endpoints (`GET /api/jobs`, `GET /api/jobs/:id`)
- Recruiterflow sync logic (webhook handler + scheduled sync)

**Reference:** [@project_documentation/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md](project_documentation/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md#phase-2-backend-development-week-3-4)

---

### Phase 3: Scoring System (Week 5-6)
**Focus:** Scoring calculation engine, scoring API endpoints

**Key Deliverables:**
- Score calculation functions (weighted composite, A/B/C ranking)
- Scoring endpoints (`POST /api/jobs/:id/score`, scoring history)
- Business logic (prevent duplicates, team aggregation)

**Scoring Model Details:** [@project_documentation/SCORING_MODEL.md](project_documentation/SCORING_MODEL.md)

---

### Phase 4: Dashboard Frontend (Week 7-8)
**Focus:** Job list/grid display with sorting and filtering

**Key Deliverables:**
- Dashboard view with job cards (client, title, days open, rank badge)
- Sorting and filtering controls
- Responsive layout

**Feature Requirements:** [@project_documentation/FEATURES.md](project_documentation/FEATURES.md#dashboard-view)

---

### Phase 5: Scoring Interface (Week 9-10)
**Focus:** Scoring form, workflow, history views

**Key Deliverables:**
- Scoring form with factor inputs (1-5 scale)
- Job-by-job navigation
- Score history and team comparison views

---

### Phase 6: Pipeline Metrics (Week 11)
**Focus:** Candidate pipeline data sync and display

**Key Deliverables:**
- Pipeline data sync from Recruiterflow
- Staleness metrics (days per stage)
- Pipeline health indicators on dashboard

---

### Phase 7: Testing & Refinement (Week 12-13)
**Focus:** Integration testing, UAT, bug fixes

**Key Deliverables:**
- End-to-end tests for key workflows
- User acceptance testing with 4 team members
- Performance optimization

---

### Phase 8: Deployment & Launch (Week 14)
**Focus:** Production deployment, monitoring, training

**Key Deliverables:**
- Live application on Cloudflare (Workers + Pages)
- Production Recruiterflow webhooks configured
- Team trained and onboarded

**Deployment Guide:** [@project_documentation/DEPLOYMENT.md](project_documentation/DEPLOYMENT.md)

---

### Phase 9: Post-Launch Iteration (Week 15+)
**Focus:** Monitor usage, gather feedback, quick wins

**Key Enhancements:**
- Notifications (email/Slack)
- Export functionality (CSV)
- Automated scoring for time-based factors

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

### MVP Success (Post-Phase 8)
- ‚úÖ All active jobs appear on dashboard
- ‚úÖ 4 team members can score jobs (<5 min per user)
- ‚úÖ A/B/C ranks calculate correctly
- ‚úÖ Historical scores persist after job closure

### Post-Launch KPIs (Phase 9+)
- 100% participation (all 4 users score weekly)
- <30 min total scoring time per week
- <5% data discrepancies vs. Recruiterflow
- A-ranked jobs show better outcomes (placement rate, time-to-fill)
