# Job Tracking and Scoring System: Master Roadmap

**Status:** In Progress ‚öôÔ∏è
**Current Phase:** Phase 4: Dashboard Frontend

---

## 1. Project Overview

This project is an internal web application for a recruitment agency to track and prioritize open jobs. It solves the problem of spreading resources across too many low-quality opportunities by implementing a systematic, team-based ranking system.

The application provides a central dashboard where team members can score jobs on multiple factors. It then calculates a weighted composite score to rank jobs into A, B, or C tiers, enabling the team to focus its efforts on the most valuable opportunities.

- **Users:** 4 internal team members (Account Manager, Sales Person, CEO, Coordinator).
- **Core Problem:** Inefficient resource allocation due to a lack of systematic focus on high-quality jobs.

## 2. Key Decisions & Principles

- **Source of Truth:** Recruiterflow is the absolute source of truth for all core job and candidate data. This scoring system supplements that data with ranking intelligence; it does not replace it.
- **Tech Stack:**
    - **Frontend:** SvelteKit on Cloudflare Pages
    - **Backend:** Hono on Cloudflare Workers
    - **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Scoring Model:** All factors are scored on a simple **1-5 scale**. Ranks are assigned based on fixed composite score thresholds (e.g., A ‚â• 4.0, B ‚â• 2.5, C < 2.5) for consistency.
- **Development Workflow:** A feature-branch workflow (`feature/...`, `fix/...`) is used in Git to ensure the `main` branch remains stable.
