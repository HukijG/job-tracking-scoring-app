## üéØ Current Phase: Phase 2.2 - Scoring API

### Phase 1 - Database & API Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETE

#### 1.1 Environment Configuration ‚úÖ
- [x] Populate `backend/.dev.vars` with Supabase credentials
- [x] Populate `frontend/.env` with API URL and Supabase keys
- [x] Test environment variable loading in both apps
- [x] Updated to new Supabase API key format (`sb_publishable_...` and `sb_secret_...`)

#### 1.2 Database Schema Implementation ‚úÖ
- [x] Create migration scripts for Supabase
- [x] Implement all 6 tables:
  - `users` - Team members
  - `jobs` - Cached job data
  - `job_scores` - Individual scoring inputs
  - `job_rankings` - Calculated A/B/C ranks
  - `pipeline_snapshots` - Candidate pipeline data
  - `sync_log` - Recruiterflow sync tracking
- [x] Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- [x] Create seed data for testing (4 users, 15 sample jobs)
- [x] Test database queries and connection

**Completed:**
- Migration file: `backend/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
- Seed file: `backend/migrations/002_seed_data.sql`
- Backend test endpoint: `GET /api/test-db`

#### 1.3 Recruiterflow API Exploration üîú
- [ ] Obtain Recruiterflow API credentials
- [ ] Test key endpoints
- [ ] Document available fields and map to internal schema
- [ ] Test webhook delivery
- [ ] Verify webhook signature validation method

**Note:** Deferred to later - focusing on core API first

---

### Phase 1 Completion Summary ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Database schema deployed to Supabase
- ‚úÖ Sample data seeded for testing
- ‚úÖ Environment variables configured
- ‚úÖ Backend connection to Supabase verified
- ‚úÖ Git repository initialized and updated

**Completed:** 2025-10-08

---

## üìÖ Next Steps: Phase 2 Tasks

### Phase 2.1: Core API Endpoints ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Priority:** HIGH | **Completed:** 2025-10-08

Implement basic CRUD endpoints for jobs data using the existing database.

#### Tasks:
- [x] **2.1.1** Create Supabase client helper function
  - Location: `backend/src/lib/supabase.ts`
  - Reusable client initialization with proper config
  - Export typed client for use across routes

- [x] **2.1.2** Implement `GET /api/jobs` endpoint
  - Fetch all active jobs from database
  - Include current ranking data (join with `job_rankings`)
  - Add query params for filtering (status, rank)
  - Sort by composite score (descending)
  - Return: Array of jobs with rankings

- [x] **2.1.3** Implement `GET /api/jobs/:id` endpoint
  - Fetch single job by ID
  - Include current ranking
  - Include scoring history (all scores for this job)
  - Include pipeline snapshots
  - Return: Job object with nested data

- [x] **2.1.4** Implement `GET /api/dashboard` endpoint
  - Aggregate data for dashboard view
  - Count jobs by rank (A/B/C)
  - Count total active jobs
  - Recent activity (latest scores/rankings)
  - Return: Dashboard summary object

- [x] **2.1.5** Test all endpoints
  - Use curl or Postman
  - Verify data structure
  - Check error handling

**Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/jobs` - Returns 10 active jobs sorted by composite score
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/jobs?rank=A` - Filter working (returns 1 A-ranked job)
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/jobs/:id` - Returns nested data (job, ranking, score history, pipeline)
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/dashboard` - Returns aggregated stats (10 active, 1 A, 1 B, 1 C)
- ‚úÖ 404 error handling - Returns proper error for non-existent job ID

---

### Phase 2.2: Scoring API üìä
**Priority:** HIGH | **Estimated Time:** 2-3 days

Implement endpoints for submitting and calculating job scores.

#### Tasks:
- [ ] **2.2.1** Create scoring calculation functions
  - Location: `backend/src/lib/scoring.ts`
  - Calculate weighted composite score
  - Determine A/B/C rank based on score
  - Reference: [@project_documentation/SCORING_MODEL.md](project_documentation/SCORING_MODEL.md)

- [ ] **2.2.2** Implement `POST /api/jobs/:id/score` endpoint
  - Accept scoring data (4 factors, 1-5 scale)
  - Validate input (required fields, value ranges)
  - Insert into `job_scores` table
  - Recalculate job ranking
  - Insert/update `job_rankings` table
  - Return: Updated job with new ranking

- [ ] **2.2.3** Implement `GET /api/jobs/:id/scores` endpoint
  - Fetch all scores for a job
  - Include scorer information (user name, role)
  - Sort by date (newest first)
  - Return: Array of score objects

- [ ] **2.2.4** Add validation and error handling
  - Check if job exists
  - Prevent duplicate scores (same user, same date)
  - Validate scorer_id against `users` table
  - Return appropriate HTTP status codes

---

### Phase 2.3: Authentication (Optional for MVP) üîê
**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Estimated Time:** 1-2 days

Simple authentication to identify users when scoring.

#### Tasks:
- [ ] **2.3.1** Implement basic API key or JWT validation
  - Simple middleware for protected routes
  - Match user ID from token to `users` table
  - OR use Supabase Auth (simpler)

- [ ] **2.3.2** Protect scoring endpoints
  - Require authentication for POST /api/jobs/:id/score
  - Read-only endpoints can remain open for MVP

**Note:** Can be deferred if testing with hardcoded user IDs first

---

### Phase 2 Completion Criteria ‚úÖ
- [ ] All job endpoints working and tested
- [ ] Scoring submission and calculation working
- [ ] Dashboard endpoint returns aggregated data
